## INTRODUCTION
A heated arguement one evening with a couple of friends who share the same taste of kpop as a music genre inspired this simple short project. The arguement was on the evolution on the genre over the years, differences in generations (I'll soon get to that for any kpop noobs), the faux nostalgia and perhaps condescending attitude that earlier listeners tend to exhihibit for newer generations' sounds.

## What is Kpop?
Korean popular music, abbreviated as K-pop or Kpop is mainstream music that originates from South Korea. It includes many different musical elements and genres under its umbrella unlike what pop music is viewed as in western markets of the Americas and Europe . Along with Korean pop, it includes Korean rock music, hip hop, and electronic music. It is a fairly new form of music, particularly formed around the 1990s. Interestingly, contemporary Kpop is a genre whose origins can definively be pointed to a certain date: 11th April 1992 when Seo Taiji and Boys performed their music on TV for the first time and changed the country's music scene. From ballads and trot to this unique amalgamation of music sounds.

## Distinctive features of K-pop?
1. Different genres used to create different K-pop music concepts.
2. Choreographies that rely on hard-hitting, synchronized movements, with members switching positions multiple times in a routine: “formation changing” . The movements are repetitive and addicting to look

## Kpop Generations
### First Generation
The first generation began after disbanded and retired. In 1996, SM Entertainment, inspired by Seo Taiji and Boys, American boy bands, and Japanese idol production decided to create the first K-pop idol group, H.O.T. After, groups such as Sechs Kies, g.o.d, Shinhwa, S.E.S, Fin.K.L, and Baby V.O.X were created.

A small data science project to combine practicing my data visualization and machine learning skills with my favorite band, DAY6. DAY6 is a Korean band under JYP Entertainment that has released over 80 songs across multiple albums and EPs. I extracted data from Spotify's Web API using Spotipy to get musical characteristics of every song in the band's discography (excluding multiple versions of the same song) and made some data visualizations as well as performed K-Means Clustering on the data.
