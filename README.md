## INTRODUCTION
A heated arguement one evening with a couple of friends who share the same taste of kpop as a music genre inspired this simple short project. The arguement was on the evolution on the genre over the years, differences in generations (I'll soon get to that for any kpop noobs), the faux nostalgia and perhaps condescending attitude that earlier listeners tend to exhihibit for newer generations' sounds.

## What is Kpop?
Korean popular music, abbreviated as K-pop or Kpop is mainstream music that originates from South Korea. It includes many different musical elements and genres under its umbrella unlike what pop music is viewed as in western markets of the Americas and Europe . Along with Korean pop, it includes Korean rock music, hip hop, and electronic music. It is a fairly new form of music, particularly formed around the 1990s. Interestingly, contemporary Kpop is a genre whose origins can definively be pointed to a certain date: 11th April 1992 when Seo Taiji and Boys performed their music on TV for the first time and changed the country's music scene. From ballads and trot to this unique amalgamation of music sounds.

##
## Distinctive features of K-pop?
1. Different genres used to create different K-pop music concepts.
2. Choreographies that rely on hard-hitting, synchronized movements, with members switching positions multiple times in a routine: “formation changing” . The movements are repetitive and addicting to look.

## Kpop Generations
### First Generation
Years: 1996-2004
The first generation began after disbanded and retired. In 1996, SM Entertainment, inspired by Seo Taiji and Boys, American boy bands, and Japanese idol production decided to create the first K-pop idol group, H.O.T. After, groups such as Sechs Kies, g.o.d, Shinhwa, S.E.S, Fin.K.L, and Baby V.O.X were created among others.
### Second Generation
Years: 2005-2012
Popular Artists: TVXQ, Super Junior, Big Bang, SS501, SHINee, 2PM, Girls' Generation, Wonder Girls, KARA, BEAST (now Highlight), Infinite, MBLAQ, B1A4, 2NE1, 4Minute, T-ara, f(x), Secret, Miss A, Apink, Girl's Day, Sistar.
The transition from the first generation to the second generation was very distinct as towards the end of the generation, most of it's idols had retired and left the music scene in its entirety.
### Third Generation
Years: 2013-2017
Popular Artists: BTS, EXO, Seventeen, NU'EST, VIXX, GOT7, WINNER, iKON, MONSTA X, NCT, BLACKPINK, TWICE, Red Velvet, AOA, EXID, Mamamoo, Lovelyz, GFRIEND, OH MY GIRL, WJSN.
The transition between the second and third generations wasn't as distinct as the first and second generations because the second generation idols were active during this period.
### Fourth Generation
Years: 2019-Present
Popular Artists: TOMORROW X TOMORROW, TREASURE, ENHYPEN, Stray Kids, ATEEZ, The Boyz, Verivery, ITZY, aespa, (G)I-DLE, STAYC, NiziU, Everglow
There is the suggestion that says that the fourth generation idols are yet to come because third-generation idols are still at the top. However, since the K-pop idol industry is very saturated, it seems that the current third-generation idols at the top today won't be changing any time soon. And there's an undeniable difference between these groups and third generation ones whether it be soundwise or performancewise.

A small data science project to combine practicing my data visualization and machine learning skills with my favorite band, DAY6. DAY6 is a Korean band under JYP Entertainment that has released over 80 songs across multiple albums and EPs. I extracted data from Spotify's Web API using Spotipy to get musical characteristics of every song in the band's discography (excluding multiple versions of the same song) and made some data visualizations as well as performed K-Means Clustering on the data.
